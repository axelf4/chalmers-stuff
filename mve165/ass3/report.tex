\section{Production revenue}\label{sec:prod_revenue}

We assign indices $\mathcal L = \{1, \ldots 7\}$ to the tentative locations,
see figure~\ref{fig:loc_numbering}, with the two distinct groups being
$ \mathcal G_1 = \{1, 2, 3\}, \mathcal G_2 = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
Define $\mathcal E$ as the set of directed possible wind wake edges,
chosen so that for $(c, d) \in \mathcal E$ the angle between $c$ and $d$
is between west and east, exlusively and inclusively respectively.
The set of possible blade lengths is denoted
$$ \mathcal B = \{\text{long}, \text{medium}, \text{short}\} $$
Let $x_l^b$ be a logical toggle whether
a turbine is installed at location $l \in \mathcal L$
with blade $b \in \mathcal B$,
and for all $(c, d) = e \in \mathcal E$ let $y_e^{ab}, \, a, b \in \mathcal B$
whether turbines with blades $a$ and $b$ are installed at $c$ and $d$ respectively.
Then the objective is
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		\max_{x, y} \quad & f_\text{rev} \coloneqq p_\text{el}\sum_{\mathclap{d \in \text{Directions}}} \frac{\text{freq}(d)}{100} \left( \sum_{\substack{l \in \mathcal L \\ b \in \mathcal B}} \text{AE}(d, b) \, x_l^b - \sum_{\substack{e \in \mathcal E \\ a,b \in \mathcal B}} \text{WE}(d, e, a, b) y_e^{ab} \right) \\
        \text{s.t.} \quad & x, y \in \mathbb B \\
		& \sum_b x_l^b \le 1 \; \forall l \in \mathcal L, \quad \sum_{l, b} x_l^b \le n \\
& x_c^a + x_d^b \le 1 + y_e^{ab}, \quad \forall (c, d) = e \in \mathcal E, \; a, b \in \mathcal B
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $p_\text{el}$ is the price of electricity,
$$ \text{AE}(d, b) = \sum_{\mathclap{v \in \text{WindSpeeds}}} \mathbb P(v \vert \text{mws}(d)) \, \text{effect}(v, b), \quad b \in \mathcal B $$
is the average effect from wind in direction $d \in \text{Directions}$
from a turbine with blade $b$,
with the uncertainty in wind speed and direction integrated out, and
\begin{align*}
	\text{WE}(d, e, a, b) = &(1 - \text{relPowerLevel}(d, e, a)) \, \text{AE}(d, b) \\
	+ &(1 - \text{relPowerLevel}(d, -e, b)) \, \text{AE}(d, a), \\
	& d \in \text{Directions}, e \in \mathcal E, \; a,b \in \mathcal B
\end{align*}
are the average wake effects for direction $d$ associated with
two turbines across the edge $e$ with blades $a$ and $b$ respectively.

	\input{loc_numbering.pdf_tex}
	\caption{The numbering scheme used in defining the location node index set $\mathcal L$, and direction of the edges in $\mathcal E$. \label{fig:loc_numbering}}
\end{figure}

We consider three distinct policies for choosing blade sizes:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Only medium blades: Add constraints
		$$ x_l^{[\text{long}, \text{short}]} = 0 \quad \forall l \in \mathcal L $$
	\item One type of blade for each group:
		Add variables $h_i^b, i = 1, 2; b \in \mathcal B$ and constraints
		$$ x_l^b \le h_i^b \; \forall l \in \mathcal G_i, i = 1,2 \quad \sum_b h_i^b = 1 \forall i $$
	\item Any blade per turbine.
\end{enumerate}
The results are shown in table~\ref{tab:2_res}.
A turbine placed at location $l$ is represented
by the letter \texttt L, \texttt M, or \texttt S,
corresponding to the type of blade, or,
in the absence of a turbine, \texttt \_.
Looking at the objective values we can conclude that
the cases (a), (b), and (c) are in order of restrictiveness
since the costs are increasing.
We see that for the case where no consideration was
given to wake effects there is no incentive to spread out turbines,
and in fact they are all adjacent.
The CPU times of all optimization runs were negligible.

\section{Investment costs}
We add variables $g_{1,2}$ corresponding to whether each of the two groups
have been exploited,
and relate them to $x$ through the added constraints
$$ x_l^b \le g_i \quad \forall l \in \mathcal G_i, b \in \mathcal B, \quad i=1,2$$
where $\mathcal G_i$ contains the indices of the locations
in the respective group.
Then the investment costs become
$$ f_\text{inv} = \text{locationCost} \, \sum x + \sum_{l \in \mathcal L, b} \text{bladeCost}(b) \, x_l^b + \text{groupCost} \, \sum g $$

If we try to minimize the investment costs with the added requirement
that the average production does not fall below
the best value obtained in \ref{sec:prod_revenue}(a) for $n=4$
(\num[round-mode=places,round-precision=2]{979.8336445553704})
we obtain as the optimal solution
$$ \text{Obj} = 80.0, \quad \text{Loc} = \verb+_LL____+ $$
As expected only one group is exploited.

\section{Multi-objective optimization}
We use the $\epsilon$\nobreakdash-constraint method,
and maximize the average revenue with
a variable cap $\epsilon$ on the maximum investment costs.
By minimizing and maximizing the investment costs in isolation
we can conclude that
$$ \epsilon \in [0, 271] $$
See figure~\ref{fig:pareto_front} which shows the objective plane
together with the Pareto front.
We find that it is approximately linear.
Since the production revenue is directly proportional to the
price of electricity any change to that quantity
would only alter the slope.
The placement of sampled solutions that are weak Pareto-optimal
follows a step function save for a few points,
as there is a minimum cost for the next production improvement,
i.e. new turbine or better blade.
The points in-between the larger steps are from additions of turbines
with blade other than the largest ones.
It is worth noting that a higher sample count would yield
more variety in production revenue -
the first solution with $f_\text{rev} \ne 0$ uses large blades for example.

\section{Lagrangian relaxation}
For the model presented in section~\ref{sec:prod_revenue}
we Lagrangian relax the constraints on the $y$ variables,
$$ \underbrace{x_c^a + x_d^b - y_e^{ab}}_{\eqqcolon g_i(x, y)} \le \underbrace1_{\eqqcolon b_i} \forall e, a, b \implies b_i - g_i \ge 0 \, \forall i$$
that model the wake effects.
The Lagrangian subproblem becomes
\begin{align*}
	h(v) \coloneqq& \max_{x,y} f_\text{rev} + \sum v_i (b_i - g_i) \\
	=& \sum_i v_i + \max_x \sum_{l, b} (c_l^b - \sum_{\deg l} v_j) x_l^b + \sum \max (v_i - c_y^e) y_e
\end{align*}
where we have omitted repeating the other constraints,
interpolated $f_\text{rev}$ and simplified,
separated the problems of the $x$ and $y$ variables
and moved the maximum of the $y$ variables in under the sum,
since constraints are only on individual $y$:s.
If we start with initial value $v=0$ as is often done,
then for the first iteration all $y^{(0)}=0, x^{(0)}=1$,
which leads to the production of each turbine being unrealistically large
since no wake effects are taken into account.
In such situations, if we choose to update $v$ by means of gradient descent,
since the partial derivaties are
$$ h_i^{(k)} = \frac{\partial h}{\partial v_i} = 1 - \sum_{l \in \text{adj}(e), b} x_l^b + y_e $$
where the sum is over all locations adjacent to the edge $e$,
we will increase $v_i$ corresponding to the edges
where the turbines are installed on both sides yet $y_e=0$.
