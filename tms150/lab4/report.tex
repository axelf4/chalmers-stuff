\section{Introduction}
This laboration covers logistic regression and decision theory with Bayesian statistics.
In order to look at the relationship between maturity of knees and age,
logistic regression is employed.
Meanwhile, decision theory can be applied to everything
where one can define a cost function,
describing the relative \emph{badness} of the different possible actions,
but in this lab it is used for stock optimization.

\section{Assignment 1(a)}\label{sec:max_proof}
\subsection{Problem}
Prove that $\mathbb E[u(t)]$ is maximized as a function of
$\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ when $\mu - k\sigma^2/2$ is maximized.
\subsection{Theory and implementation}
The utility function $u$ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:utility}
u(x) = \frac{1 - (x / K)^{-k}}k
\end{equation}
where $k \neq 0$ is a parameter and $K$ is the amount invested.
\subsection{Results and discussion}
\begin{align*}
	\mathbb E[u(t)] &= \int_\infty^\infty \frac{1 - e^{-yk}}k \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}
		\exp\left(-\frac1{2\sigma^2} (y - \mu)^2\right) \, dy \\
		&= \frac1k \left(\underbrace{\int_\infty^\infty \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac1{2\sigma^2} (y - \mu)^2\right) \, dy}_{=1, \, \text{for integral of pdf of normal distribution}}
		- \int_\infty^\infty e^{-yk} \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac1{2\sigma^2} (y - \mu)^2\right) \, dy\right) \\
		&= \frac1k \left(1 - \int_\infty^\infty \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}
			\exp\left(\underbrace{-yk - \frac1{2\sigma^2} (y - \mu)^2}_{\begin{subarray}{1}
				= y^2 - 2y(\mu - \sigma^2k) + \mu^2 \\
				= (y - (\mu - \sigma^2k))^2 + 2\sigma^2k\mu - (\sigma^2k)^2
			\end{subarray}}\right) \, dy\right) \\
		&= \frac1k \left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{2\sigma^2k\mu - (\sigma^2k)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
			\int_\infty^\infty \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac1{2\sigma^2} (y - (\mu - \sigma^2k))^2\right) \, dy\right) \\
		&= \frac1k \left(1 - \exp\left(-k \left(\mu - \frac{k\sigma^2}2\right)\right)\right)
\end{align*}
which is maximized when $\mu - k\sigma^2/2$ is maximized, since
$\left(1 - \exp\left(-k x\right)\right) / k$
is an increasing function of $x$, regardless of $k \ne 0$.

\section{Assignment 1(b)}
\subsection{Problem}
Optimize the weights in the case of two stocks,
using the utility function from equation~\ref{eq:utility}.
\subsection{Theory and implementation}
With $X_{ij}$ as the closing price of stock $i$ after day $j$ we define
$$ Z_{ij} \coloneqq \log\left(\frac{X_{ij}}{X_{i,j-1}}\right) $$
as the relative change in stock price from day to day,
we say that the vectors $Z_j$ are independent and
$$ Z_j \sim \Normal(\gamma, \Sigma) $$
for some vector $\gamma$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$.
Choosing a set of weights $w = (w_1, \ldots, w_k), \quad \sum_{i=1}^k w_i = 1$,
we define
$$ T = K \prod_{i=1}^k \exp(w_i n Z_i) = K \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i n Z_i\right)
	= K \exp(n w^T Z) = K \exp(Y) $$
where $T$ is the total amount after $n$ days, given an amount $K$ invested,
and $Y \coloneqq n w^T Z$.
Now
$$ Y \sim \Normal(n w^T \gamma, n w^T \Sigma w) = \Normal(\gamma, \sigma^2) $$
with the added notation
$\gamma \coloneqq n w^T \gamma$ and $\sigma^2 \coloneqq n w^T \Sigma w$.

Decision theory tells us that we should pick the weights $w$ so that
$\mathbb E[u(T)]$ is maximized.
But in section~\ref{sec:max_proof} we saw that this is equivalent to maximizing
$$ F(w) = \mu - k \sigma^2 / 2 $$

The R function \texttt{optim} is used to maximize.
\subsection{Results and discussion}
The optimized stock weight is shown in figure~\ref{fig:stock_weights}.
We see that the \texttt{Comp1} ratio decreases with $k$,
which should imply that \texttt{Comp1} is more instable
- it is also the case that
$\num{553.2989} = \var(\text{\texttt{Comp1}}) > \var(\text{\texttt{Comp2}}) = \num{382.5174}$.
Expanding $F(w) = n w^T \gamma - k n w^T \Sigma w / 2$
we see that the second term is conserned with variability,
while the first term rewards weighting stocks with higher mean change more heavily.
Thus \texttt{Comp1} is favored more overall for the observed values of $k$
since $\num{0.0005275481} = \mean(Z_{1,:}) > \mean(Z_{2,:}) = \num{0.0001782805}$.

		that is the ratio that should be invested in \texttt{Comp1},
	for different values of $k$. \label{fig:stock_weights}}
\end{figure}

\section{Assignment 2(a)}
\subsection{Problem}
Fit a logistic regression to the data, by numerical maximum likelihood
given parameters $a$ and $b$.
\subsection{Theory and implementation}
There are two reports
$$ \text{reports} = \left\{\underbrace{\text{mature}}_1, \underbrace{\text{immature}}_0\right\} $$
Our model is
$$ y \sim \Bernoulli(f_1(x)), \quad f_1(x) = \frac{\exp\left(a + b (x - 18)\right)}{1 + \exp\left(a + b (x - 18)\right)} $$
$a, b \in \mathbb R$.
The likelihood is given by
$$ \mathcal L(a, b) = \prod_{\text{mature}} f_1(x) \prod_{\text{immature}} f_0(x) $$
\subsection{Results and discussion}
The fitted logistic regression curve is shown in figure~\ref{fig:logistic_regression}.
We see that the result seems plausible since the location where the curve
changes from $0$ to $1$ happens in the middle of the two datasets.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{logistic_regression.tex}
	\caption{Plot of the data together with the obtained logistic regression curve. \label{fig:logistic_regression}}
\end{figure}

\section{Assignment 2(b)}
\subsection{Problem}
On a $100 \times 100$ evenly spaced grid of $a$ and $b$ compute and plot
the posterior,
given a uniform prior.
\subsection{Theory and implementation}
Bayes formula for probability mass functions looks like
$$ \pi(x \mid y) = \frac{\pi(y \mid x) \pi(x)}{\pi(y)} $$

The posterior on the grid is visualized with the \texttt{image} R function.
\subsection{Results and discussion}
The posterior on the grid is given in figure~\ref{fig:posterior}.
We see that there is an area, not too small,
where values of $a$ and $b$ are approximately equally likely.
That is to say there exists some uncertainty.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{posterior.tex}
	\caption{The posterior on the $a, b$ grid from $-0.4, 0.9$ to $2.1, 3.1$.
		The whiter areas contain smaller densities, while the redder contain larger.
	\label{fig:posterior}}
\end{figure}

\section{Assignment 2(c)}\label{sec:optimal_decision}
\subsection{Problem}
With the ML estimates of $a$ and $b$,
for each cost function, $c_1$; $c_2$,
find $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ in the distribution of true ages so that
the optimal decision is to classify those with mature knees as adults.
\subsection{Theory and implementation}
Given $\alpha, \mu > 0$ the true age probablity density is assumed to be given by
$$ \pi(x; \mu, \alpha) = \begin{cases}
	0, & x < 14 \\
	\GammaD(x - 14; \alpha, \alpha / (\mu - 14)), & x \ge 14
\end{cases} $$
The two cost functions in question are defined as
$$ c_1(x) = \begin{cases} B, & x \le 18 \\ 1, & x > 18 \end{cases}
\quad \text{and} \quad
c_2(x) = \begin{cases} B (18 - x), & x \le 18 \\ x - 18, & x > 18 \end{cases} $$
where $B$ is fixed to $B = 10$.
They represent the cost of misclassifying someone whose true age is $x$ years.
Now
\begin{equation}\label{eq:costs}
C_c = \int_{18}^\infty \pi(x; \mu, \alpha) f_k(x) c(x) \, dx, \quad C_a = \int_0^{18} \pi(x; \mu, \alpha) f_k(x) c(x) \, dx
\end{equation}
give the expected cost of misclassification
if one classifies as child or adult respectively.
Therefore if $C_c < C_a$ on should classify as children, otherwise as adults.

The optimal decision is queried over a grid of reasonable $\mu$ and $\alpha$ values
from $15, 2$ to $25, 9$ and the result is visualized.
\subsection{Results and discussion}
The optimal decision over the grid is shown in figure~\ref{fig:optimal_decision}.

\end{figure}

\section{Assignment 2(d)}
\subsection{Problem}
Re-do the problem in section~\ref{sec:optimal_decision},
but integrate over the uncertainty when computing the costs in equation~\ref{eq:costs}.
\subsection{Theory and implementation}
\subsection{Results and discussion}
The optimal decision over the grid is shown in figure~\ref{fig:optimal_decision}.
We see that the results are identical to the ones from section~\ref{sec:optimal_decision}.
